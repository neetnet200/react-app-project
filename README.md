🐱‍👓 I'm building a fully responsive React website from scratch 
🐱‍👓 Creating a form with a submit button, and connecting React JS frontend with Node JS Express backend
🐱‍👓 Vanilla CSS used to style throughout: using a restricted palette as if for a client
🐱‍👓 Showing examples of work which will be static websites hosted with GitHub pages
